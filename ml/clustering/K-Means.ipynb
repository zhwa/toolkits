    "## The Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you are given a data set where each observed example has a set of features, but has no labels. Labels are an essential ingredient to a supervised algorithm like Support Vector Machines, which learns a hypothesis function to predict labels given features. So we can't run supervised learning. What can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most straightforward tasks we can perform on a data set without labels is to find groups of data in our dataset which are similar to one another -- what we call clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is one of the most popular \"clustering\" algorithms. K-means stores $k$ centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means finds the best centroids by alternating between (1) assigning data points to clusters based on the current centroids (2) chosing centroids (points which are the center of a cluster) based on the current assignment of data points to clusters."

(c-f) Illustration of running two iterations of k-means. In each iteration, we assign each training example to the closest cluster centroid (shown by \"painting\" the training examples the same color as the cluster centroid to which is assigned); then we move each cluster centroid to the mean of the points assigned to it.

    "In the clustering problem, we are given a training set ${x^{(1)}, ... , x^{(m)}}$, and want to group the data into a few cohesive \"clusters.\" Here, we are given feature vectors for each data point $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ as usual; but no labels $y^{(i)}$ (making this an unsupervised learning problem). Our goal is to predict $k$ centroids and a label $c^{(i)}$ for each datapoint. The k-means clustering algorithm is as follows:\n",
